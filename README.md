# NetPi Network Analyzer - A RaspberryPi Project

NetPi Network Analyzer based on Raspberry Pi b+/2/3 hardware

Based on original work first by [BlameTheNetwork](http://www.blamethenetwork.com/netpi) and later expanded by [ITSaDC](https://www.itsadc.com/the-netpi/).

It turns out, the [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) makes a handy device for quick and dirty network testing. You don't need to shell out thousands of dollars on &lt;NAMEBRAND&gt; equipment. You can get basic connectivity testing for well under $100 with just a little hardware and open-source software. Standing on the aforementioned giants to started putting this together in 2015, I've made my own modifications and am sharing them here.

My contributions in this fork are

* updating the file structure so that everything can be consolidated in one location (ie <code>/opt</code>)
* updating scripts so they work using current Raspbian tools
* adding scripts for improved functionality
* adding documentation to get up and running easily
* refactoring php files to improve modularity
* improving display layout to make it more readily scalable
* clean out deprecated scripts
