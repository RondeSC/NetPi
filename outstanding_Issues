-------- desireable actions, yet to be accomblished
-To auto start up lldpd with the -r option. Neither the pre-setup at OS startup action nor 'service lldpd start' seems to support it.
  Prehaps something like "sudo lldpd -r &" should be in .bash.rc or .profile
-Yet to log 'speed tests'


-------- Odd behavior
-When the likes of 'RUN-ACTIVE' are placed on the desktop they can not be run from the desktop GUI even thou there mode is: rwxr-xr-x
  I had to rename them as .sh files in order to launch them from the desktop.
-When 'lldp-info' runs and the lldpd daemon is not present and this executes: gksu -u pi "sudo lldpd -r &"
  A password for 'root' is asked for, It should be asking for 'pi's password. I however does except the pi PW
